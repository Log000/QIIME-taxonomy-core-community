# QIIME-taxonomy-core-community
Code to extract core communities (and other information) for all samples, and specific metadata after downloading csv files from QIIME's taxonomic bar plots visualization (QZV)  


WARNING!!! Since "tidyverse" had an update, code is not fully functional.

Future
  Comments to easily follow the code are needed, and will be added soon.
  Some parts of the code will be turned into function, also soon.
